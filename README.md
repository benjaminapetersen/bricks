# Bricks
An experiment in composable css attributes for building UI with flexbox in mind. Inspired by Polymer layout &amp; Angular Material CSS.


# Painting The Fence

So first you build a structure, then you paint it.  Thats the idea behind this
small css lib based on flexbox.  The layout is entirely generated with
attributes, then classes are used to provide the look and feel.  There is a
clear separation of concerns between structural and cosmetic styles.  The
cosmetics are up to you to provide (there are a few fun little helpers and
things provided), this lib provides the foundation.

## data-* required to be html5 compliant?

Thinking about this. Sure is ugly :)
